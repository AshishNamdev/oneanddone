How to Find Tasks
------------------

Situation
^^^^^^^^^
Once you have signed in with Persona and created a profile, the next step is to
find a task to work on.

Steps
^^^^^
There are two places you can find tasks: the Homepage
[https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/en-US/] and the Available Tasks page
[https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/en-US/tasks/available/].

Go to one of these pages. The Homepage features Suggested Tasks which are good
for new contributors. Available Tasks features all possible tasks, sorted by
difficulty.

From here you have a few options:
    * Explore! Click on the name of any task that sounds interesting, and read
    all about it on the Task Detail page.
    * Search. Add words in the Search Box that match your interests or skills.
    The search feature will bring up matching tasks based on the name, the
    content, tags, product names, etc.
    * Filter. Select one or more checkboxes from the Filter by Area sidebar.
    You may filter by team name, by product, or by the type of task you are
    interested in. Click the "Filter tasks" button when you are ready to see the
    results. If no results appear, try running it with different choices.

How to Do Tasks
------------------

Situation
^^^^^^^^^
You have found a task you would like to try, so what is next?

Steps
^^^^^
    #. Click the linked name of the task so you can view the task detail page.
    An example would be Exploratory Testing on Mozillians
    [https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/en-US/tasks/10/].
    #. If the task is available, you will see the Get Started button.
    #. You must be logged in before being able to take the task. If the button
    is blue and enabled, clicking it will give you the task.
    #. Once you have the task, you have a few choices. The first is to work through
    all of the steps and complete the task. After you have done the work you can
    click the "Complete task" button.
    #. If you are working on the task and have a question, or you get stuck, you
    should read the "Need Help?" section to see how to contact someone who can
    help you. Each task has unique information on how to contact mentors for
    help.
    #. If you find a bug or have a problem, ask for help using the Need Help?
    section. If you cannot proceed because of the bug, you may click "Complete
    task". You should add any bug numbers, or the description of the problem
    to the task feedback form.
    #. If you are working on the task and need to take a break, or finish up for
    the day, you can click the "Save for later" task. This saves your task for
    you. You will easily be able to find the task again, as a link displays on
    Dashboard on the Homepage, and another link is saved on your profile. Clicking
    the task link will return you to the same page so you can continue working
    on the task.
    #. If you decide that you no longer want this task, or you find another one
    that you would rather work on, you can click "Abandon task". This will remove
    the task from your Dashboard and your profile. This will also allow you to
    find a different task to work on.

How to Get Help
----------------
If you are working on the task and have a question, or you get stuck, you should
read the "Need Help?" section to see how to contact someone who can help you.
Each task has unique information on how to contact mentors for help.

How to Report Problems
----------------------

Congratulations on finding a bug!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are working through the steps in a task and find a bug, you should file
it on Bugzilla. If you aren't sure if it's a real bug, ask a question using the
Need Help? section. Each task is for a different team and product, and most tasks
include a Bugzilla link for filing bugs in the correct area. You will need to
sign into Bugzilla in order to file bugs. If there is no link in the task, ask
for one using the contact information in the Need Help? section. We rely on
contributors to report bugs they find, and reporting bugs lets us know there's a
problem. Thank you! Please include any bugs you find on the task feedback form
that appears after completing the task.

This doesn't look right
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are working through steps in a task and something isn't right it may be a
bug- or it may be that the task is out of date. This describes a problem with the
expected steps from the task, rather than a problem with what you are testing.
You can ask a question using the Need Help? section OR you can mention the issue
in the task feedback form that appears after completing the task.
